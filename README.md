# Tech Test - Laravel 9

I have been meaning to play around with Laravel 9 since it's release as it's been a couple of years since I last used the framework.

This isn't to be checked over, the test just gave me a good target of something to do on this lazy Saturday afternoon.

### Not Finished

This hasn't been tested, I'm just playing around with the validators and custom rules etc. 

### Update

Added DB to add in each request set of data from form input, will then add in a simple button to use that data to create CURL request,and then store the result in related table.

Note: Some of these Laravel 8/9 features are ðŸ”¥.
