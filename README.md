# Tech Test - Laravel 9

I have been meaning to play around with Laravel 9 since it's release as it's been a couple of years since I last used the framework.

This isn't to be checked over, the test just gave me a good target of something to do on this lazy Saturday afternoon.

### Not Finished

This hasn't been tested, I'm just playing around with the validators and custom rules etc.
